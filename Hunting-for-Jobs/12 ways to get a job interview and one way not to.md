### Don't apply directly to any job posting.

#### 1. Use the Backdoor
Once you know the job title and location, look on LinkedIn or use Google to find the name of the hiring manager or department head. If this doesn't work, call and ask someone in some other function who's the VP of the department.

#### 2. Get More Referrals.
If you're serious about getting a better job, networking to get referrals should represent 50% or more of your job hunting efforts.

#### 3. Be Different.
Example: one candidate prepare a competitive analysis for a product marketing position in the telecommunications industry. He sent it to the VP who routed it to the Director.

#### 4. Check the Postings for Similar Jobs.
In your email to the department head, mention that you've noticed that the company is looking to fill a number of related positions and you wonder who's handling all of the requisitions.

#### 5. Prove You're a Contender(竞争者).
Put a short statement in your email describing some major accomplishment that clearly reveals you're qualified for the job. Include a likn to a video or website that further validates your abilities in this area. Example: a product you worked on, a sample of your work, a credible public recommendation you received,  or a demo you prepared.

#### 6. Use Higher Authority.
In your email state you're also sending your resume to others in the company. Names names and include titles. People will be reluctant to ignore your request if the people your're contacting are more senior to the person.

#### 7. Become a Passive Candidate.
In your email mention that an assocate sent you a link to the public job description, and since you're not actively looking, you'd like to learn more before you became a serious candidate. You'll still need to prove you're a viable prospect to get noticed.

#### 8. Prepare a Prezi(or video) Resume.

#### 9. Customize Your Emails.
Don't send generic template emails. Instead do some research about the company and include some of this information in your emails. For example, describe how your technical skills could impact products the company is developing or improve some process they're upgrading.

#### 10. Reduce their Risk.
One way of a job-seeker to minimize the company risk is to offer to work on a contract or consulting basis until you can prove you're capable of handling the job and working with the people involved.

#### 11. Take Smaller Steps.
It's much easier to arrange an exploratory phone conversation with a hiring manager than arranging a formal onsite interview.

#### 12. Don't give up even if these don't work.
The key is to be different to get noticed, and once noticed, prove you can do the work even if your skills and experiences aren't a perfect match.
