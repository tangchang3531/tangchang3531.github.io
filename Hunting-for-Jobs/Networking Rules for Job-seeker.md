### Advantage:
#### 1. Bypass the gatekeepers
#### 2. Increase your chance of being interviewed and hired by 5-10X.

### How should be done:
#### 1. Meet 3-4 people who can vouch for your past performance and future potential. Example: Professor, Advisor, Church and Social connection.
#### 2. During the meeting review your resume or LinkedIn profile and ask for feedback. Then ask these people if they would be comfortable recommending you to people they know who are connected to others in companies or industries of interest.
#### 3. If the answer to Step 2 is no, find out why, and/or find some better connected people.
#### 4. If the answer to Step 2 is yes, obtain the names of 3-4 people and their contact information. Then ask the person who is vouching for you if they would  call the person on your behalf, or send an email introducing you.
#### 5. Research your connection's connections and ask about specific people.
#### 6. Network backwards
#### 7. Be direct and be proactive. Ask specific people they know and specific jobs at their companies(Found on LinkedIn). Ask to be referred to a specific person or a specific job will result in more connections and more interviews.
#### 8. Don't be a pest, but keep your network warm by maintaining an active PR campaign. Spend a few hours each week sending emails to those who have helped you in any way. Make them personal.
#### 9. Establish some metrics to stay focused. Treat the job-hunting process as a job, not a hobby. As a minimum, you'll need to track meetings per week and the number of recommendations per meeting. The overriding goal whould by 50-60 people in your job-hunting network within 2-3 weeks.

### You turn 4-5 great contacts into 50-60 connections in 2-3 weeks. It will take about 20-30 hours per week. Roughly 10-15 new contacts per week via the phone, which should convert into 5-6 one-on-one meetings every week. The rest of the time hsould be on LinkedIn researching their connections and finding open jobs in their companies
