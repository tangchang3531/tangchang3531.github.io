# Learning Experience

I write this passage to give my deepest gratitude to D.R. Liu, who has taught me large amount of technical skills as well as how to be a project manager during last summer.

The total learning period of two months could be separated into four parts. It is not basically divided by time, like two weeks per part. Some of the knowledge were taught together when necessary. Class time was not fixed and usually we use our spare time. So let's look at what I have learnt.
 -  I learnt how to use Github.
 - Second, I learnt a programming language--Python, which I am stilling learning.
 - Third, I learnt how to build a static webpage.
 - Fourth, I was also taught some skills to be a project manager. 

Yet, what D.R. Liu has taguth me was far more than these four points, like I also learnt how to use bootstrap, codepen, markdown and so on. The reason I chose these four aspects is that they could well clarify four teaching styles of D.R. Liu

### Github and related skills



### How to learn a programming language



### how to build a static webpage



### how to work as a project manager
